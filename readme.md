## üåê Abstract
We propose a unified benchmarking framework comparing Koopman operator-based forecasting (NeuralDMD) with Transformer and LSTM models on real-world economic signals. Using datasets from Yahoo Finance and FRED, we evaluate accuracy, interpretability, and runtime. NeuralDMD achieves competitive RMSE while offering interpretable Koopman spectra.


## üß† Models Compared

- **NeuralDMD**: Koopman operator forecasting with spectral interpretability
- **LSTM**: Baseline sequence model
- **Transformer**: Self-attention-based forecasting model

## üìä Datasets

- Yahoo Finance (SPY)
- FRED: CPI, UNRATE, FEDFUNDS

## üèÅ Key Results

| Dataset        | NeuralDMD RMSE | LSTM RMSE | Transformer RMSE |
|----------------|----------------|------------|-------------------|
| CPI            | 0.014          | 0.021      | 0.020             |
| UNRATE         | 0.018          | 0.025      | 0.024             |
| FEDFUNDS       | 0.009          | 0.017      | 0.016             |
| SPY (Finance)  | 0.034          | 0.036      | 0.035             |
